Hi! I'm Estella. I write digital payments documentation for the Digital Guidance team at [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/). I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2022, with a B.S. in Decision Science and an additional major in Professional Writing. 

Prior to moving to the U.S., I grew up moving between Singapore, Jakarta and Karuizawa. In my free time, I love reading, travelling, and trying new restaurants (and ranking them on Beli)! 

Feel free to reach out at [estellakarunia@gmail.com](estellakarunia@gmail.com)!
